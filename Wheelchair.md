## Autonomous Wheelchair Project

**Description:** The goal of this project was to develop an autonomous wheelchair to act as a tour guide / service for people who are in need of wheelchairs or have difficulties walking. The end goal was to deploy this wheelchair in the National Gallery. 

Wheelchair payload was designed and implemented from the ground-up where we used the Nvidia Xavier for compute. We used Google-Cartographer for mapping and the Dynamic Window Approach for local planning.
